-<h4 aligh="left"> Introduction</h4>
-  Iris flower classification is a popular problem in machine learning and pattern recognition. It involves categorizing iris flowers into different species based on their measurements of petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width.
-  The Iris flower dataset, introduced by British statistician Ronald Fisher in 1936, has become a benchmark dataset for machine learning algorithms.
-  By applying various machine learning techniques to this dataset, accurate classification models can be developed, enabling automated identification of iris flower species.
